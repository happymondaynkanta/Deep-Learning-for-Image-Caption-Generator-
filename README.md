# Deep-Learning-for-Image-Caption-Generator-
Image caption generator is a process of recognizing the context of an image and annotating it with relevant captions using deep learning, and computer vision. It includes the labeling of an image with English keywords with the help of datasets provided during model training.

# IMAGE CAPTIONING:
The goal of image captioning is to convert a given input image into a natural language description. In this blog we will be using the concept of CNN and LSTM and build a model of Image Caption Generator which involves the concept of computer vision and Natural Language Process to recognize the context of images and describe them in natural language like English.

## The task of image captioning can be divided into two modules logically

#### Image based model — Extracts the features of our image.

#### Language based model — which translates the features and objects extracted by our image based model to a natural sentence.
